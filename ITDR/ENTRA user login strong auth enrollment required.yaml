analyst_notes: >
  One of the following conditions is true:
  1. UserStrongAuthEnrollmentRequiredInterrupt - User needs to enroll for second factor authentication (interactive).
  2. UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequiredInterrupt - Strong authentication is required and the user did not pass the MFA challenge.
  3. UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequired - Due to a configuration change made by the admin such as a Conditional Access policy, per-user enforcement, or because you moved to a new location, the user must use multifactor authentication to access the resource. 
  Retry with a new authorize request for the resource.
  4. UserStrongAuthExpired- Presented multifactor authentication has expired due to policies configured by your administrator. 
  You must refresh your multifactor authentication to access '{resource}'.
  5. UserStrongAuthEnrollmentRequired - Due to a configuration change made by the admin such as a Conditional Access policy, per-user enforcement, or because the user moved to a new location, the user is required to use multifactor authentication. 
  Either a managed user needs to register security info to complete multifactor authentication, or a federated user needs to get the multifactor claim from the federated identity provider.
