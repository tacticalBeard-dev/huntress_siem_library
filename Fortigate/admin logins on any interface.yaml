analyst_notes: >
  These event codes show admin login attempts for any interface.
  Event code 32002 is Admin Logon Failed and 32001 is Admin Logon Success.
  These events can give an indication of normal vs abnormal source and username attempts.
  Excessive failed login attempts should be investigated to determine intent and point of origin.
  The method (FTNTFGTmethod) used can also distinguish https vs ssh login types.
